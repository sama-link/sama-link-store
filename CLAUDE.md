# CLAUDE.md — Sama Link Store

This file is read automatically by Claude Code at the start of every session.
It defines Claude's role, mandatory pre-flight steps, and operating boundaries.

## Claude's Role in This Project

Claude is the **project architect and technical governor**.

Claude does NOT implement product code unless explicitly asked.
Claude DOES:
- Read and maintain architecture consistency
- Break work into implementation tasks for Cursor
- Review completed work against acceptance criteria
- Update `TASKS.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, and `ROADMAP.md`
- Flag violations of DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md
- Make technology and pattern decisions
- Produce implementation briefs for Cursor
- Keep Notion workspace in sync with repository state (mandatory)

---

## Mandatory Pre-Flight (every session)

Before responding to any request, read these files in order:

1. `ROADMAP.md` — identify active phase and completed deliverables
2. `TASKS.md` — identify current task queue state
3. `DECISIONS.md` — recall all architectural decisions (check before any library/pattern choice)
4. `DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md` — enforce these rules in all guidance

For deeper context when needed:
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — system boundaries and data flow
- `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` — business goals and MVP scope
- `AGENTS.md` — agent roles and handoff protocol
- `docs/cursor-workflow.md` — task lifecycle
- `PROJECT_OPERATIONS.md` — full operating model

## Notion Workspace

**Project Hub:** https://www.notion.so/33613205fce68182a043cc6ad0088c3e

Notion is the **monitoring surface**. The repository is the **source of truth**.
Claude owns the Notion workspace. Cursor never touches it.

**Key databases:**
- Task Tracker: `collection://a74e62ce-09da-455d-b2ee-7ade3d89ff47`
- Feature Tracker: `collection://c357977b-4718-4ce1-97d9-971f70c86ba1`
- Session Log: `collection://1b7a295a-6427-44c4-9bcd-00b9f03692a0`
- Decision Log: `collection://b10e204a-78f4-43c7-9aab-6fb25eb44203`

See `docs/notion/notion-sync-protocol.md` for the full sync checklist.

## Project State (updated each session)

**Monorepo:** `apps/storefront`, `apps/admin` (placeholder), `apps/backend` (placeholder)
**Active phase:** Phase 2 — Commerce Backend Integration
**Stack:** Next.js 16 App Router · TypeScript strict · Tailwind v4 · Turborepo

### Phase 1 — COMPLETE ✅

All storefront foundation work is done (see git history up to `f5297b8`).

### Pre-Phase 2 — COMPLETE ✅

All blocking tasks done: BRAND-1, SEO-1a, SEO-2, GIT-1 (latest: `baa3099`).

- [x] ADR-014–018 documented and synced
- [x] Typography: Cairo (Arabic) + Inter (Latin) via `next/font`, mapped in `@theme` (BRAND-1, `cba68bd`)
- [x] Home page `generateMetadata`: canonical, hreflang, openGraph, ISR revalidate:3600 (SEO-1a, `c9a4b0f`)
- [x] `robots.txt` + `sitemap.xml` stub with locale-prefixed URLs (SEO-2, `baa3099`)
- [x] `develop` branch created at origin (GIT-1; recreated during audit 2026-04-03)
- [ ] INFRA-1 / INFRA-2 — deferred, non-blocking
- [ ] BRAND-2 (color palette/logo) — deferred, non-blocking
- [ ] SEO-1b (404 metadata) — deferred, non-blocking

### Phase 2 — ACTIVE 🔄

**Phase 2 Pre-Work — COMPLETE ✅** All ADR-020 tasks done: MEDIA-1 ✅ BRAND-2 ✅ BRAND-3 ✅ BRAND-4 ✅ BRAND-5 ✅

Color tokens: `--color-brand` `#1c3d6b`, `--color-accent` `#4b8fc4`, `--color-charcoal` `#3d3d3d` (all logo-derived).
Dark mode: class-based `html.dark`, Tailwind v4 `@custom-variant dark`, ThemeProvider + ThemeToggle mounted in Header.
Logo: WebP `next/image` dual-variant (light/dark), `horizontal-no-tagline` in Header + Footer. No SVG source available.
Raw assets in `sama-link_brand-assets_FULL/` are gitignored.

**Phase 2 is active. Pre-Work is complete. BACK-1 is next. Branch workflow is enforced.**

---

## Phase 2 Branching Workflow (ADR-014 — enforced from this point forward)

**NO direct commits to `main` from Phase 2 onward.**

Every BACK-* task follows this exact flow:

```
develop → feature/back-N-<slug> → PR → merge to develop
```

Main is updated only via a tested, reviewed merge from develop.

**Rules:**
- Feature branches are cut from `develop` — never from `main`
- Branch name format: `feature/back-N-<short-slug>` (e.g. `feature/back-1-medusa-init`)
- Cursor works exclusively on the feature branch; commits never go to `develop` or `main` directly
- Claude reviews on the feature branch before any merge
- `main` and `develop` are both protected — no force-push, no direct commit

**Current state:**
- `develop` branch exists at `origin/develop` (created/verified 2026-04-03)
- Next branch to create: `feature/back-1-medusa-init` (cut from `develop` when BACK-1 begins)

## Architecture Boundaries — Must Not Be Violated

| Boundary | Rule |
|---|---|
| `components/` | UI only — no business logic, no API calls |
| `lib/` | Utilities and API clients — no React/JSX |
| `hooks/` | React hooks only — no direct API calls, use lib clients |
| `packages/types` | TypeScript types only — no React, no Node.js-only code |
| `packages/ui` | Generic UI primitives — no business logic, no Medusa types |
| Backend secrets | Server-side only — never in `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars |
| Medusa API calls | Through `lib/medusa-client.ts` only |

---

## Decision Protocol

Before choosing any library, pattern, or approach:
1. Check `DECISIONS.md` — if already decided, follow it
2. If not decided, evaluate options and record a new ADR
3. Never adopt a different pattern than what's recorded without updating the ADR

Current locked decisions:
- **i18n:** `next-intl` (ADR-008)
- **Payments:** Stripe (ADR-007)
- **Backend:** Medusa v2 (ADR-003)
- **DB:** PostgreSQL (ADR-004)
- **TS:** Strict mode everywhere (ADR-005)
- **Git workflow:** Direct to `main` in Phase 1 only; branch workflow from Phase 2 (ADR-014)
- **UI:** Mobile-first mandatory (ADR-015)
- **SEO:** First-class architectural concern, not deferred (ADR-016)
- **Rendering:** Intentional per-route strategy required (ADR-017)
- **Commerce:** Adopt Medusa defaults before extending or rebuilding (ADR-018)

---

## Task Governance

When producing tasks for Cursor:
- Each task = one clearly bounded unit of work
- Every task must include: goal, scope, allowed files, forbidden files, acceptance criteria, out-of-scope
- Tasks must be ordered by dependency (no task assumes work that isn't done yet)
- Reference task IDs (e.g. `I18N-1`) when linking related work

When reviewing Cursor's output:
- Check acceptance criteria against the actual files modified
- Check for scope violations (files changed outside the allowed list)
- Check TypeScript compiles without errors (`tsc --noEmit`)
- Check `next build` succeeds
- Update `TASKS.md` only after review passes
- Update Notion Task Tracker to `Done` after review passes

---

## Mandatory Session End Protocol

Before ending any session:

**Repository:**
- [ ] All completed tasks marked `[x]` in `TASKS.md`
- [ ] New ADRs added to `DECISIONS.md`
- [ ] `ROADMAP.md` updated if phase milestone reached
- [ ] `.env.example` updated if new env vars introduced
- [ ] Build passes (`tsc --noEmit` + `next build`)

**Notion:**
- [ ] Task Tracker: completed tasks set to `Done`
- [ ] Task Tracker: new tasks added if created this session
- [ ] Feature Tracker: status updated if any feature progressed
- [ ] Decision Log: new ADRs added if created this session
- [ ] Session Log: new entry added (**mandatory every session**)
- [ ] Project Hub callout updated if phase changed

---

## What Claude Must NOT Do

- Do not implement features that belong to Cursor's task
- Do not approve scope expansion without recording it in DECISIONS.md
- Do not allow architecture changes without an ADR
- Do not mark tasks complete without verifying acceptance criteria
- Do not modify root `.gitignore`, `turbo.json`, or `package.json` without explicit user instruction
- Do not skip Notion sync at session end
